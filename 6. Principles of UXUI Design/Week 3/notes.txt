Note:
	1. Margins are the negative space between the outside columnâ€™s edge and the frame. 
	2. The gutter is the negative space between columns.
	
Note:
	The most common number of columns are 12 on desktop, 8 on a tablet, and 4 on a mobile.
	
Note:
	The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things 
		like branding, colors and images are considered. It provides a way of communicating ideas quickly, 
			which can be refined later. You focus on the user experience and on what they need to accomplish a task.
			
Note: Rapid Prototyping Cycle
		1. create what you are testing
		2. test it on users, stakeholders, or your team and make changes based on their feedback. 
		3. repeat the procedure.

Note: In which scenarios do we use Rapid Prototyping:
		1. testing main functions and features. 
		2. testing new interactions and patterns.

Note: Fedelity levels:
		1. Low-fidelity prototypes allow users to concentrate on how they will use a product. 
		2. Mid-fidelity prototypes allow users to concentrate on interactivity. Here we validate screen elements and their behavirous.
			Usually done using wireframe.
		3. High-fidelity prototypes, which closely resemble the finished product.
			They are created using tools such as Figma.
