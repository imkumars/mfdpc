Version Control:
	WEEK 1:
		Note: Some popular version control softwares:
				Subversion ------CVCS
				Perforce
				AWS Code Commit
				Mercurial     -------DVCS
				BitKeeper      ------DVCS
				Git            ------DVCS
		

		Note: Version control can be 
				Centralized version(CVCS): Where we have server client model. 
										   Client needs to pull code from the server
										   Whenever code is updated by client, client has to make sure it is conneted to server. And push the changes back to server
										   This means that all operations have to be done using a centralized server.
										   If the server were down or slow, this would impede(delay) development.
										   Its like being online.
				
				Distributed version(DVCS): Here also we have server client model.
										   Client needs to pull code from the server.
										   Once code has been pulled by client, client now can modify without being conneted to server.
										   Its works as offline mode.

	WEEK 2:
		Unix Commands:
			Note:
				mkdir -p dir1/dir2          -----this creats directory dir1 and inside that directory create another directory called dir2. this was possiblebecause of -p (parent)flage
				
				
			Note: Redirect:
				Input Ex: cat < newText1.txt   ----------read from newText1.txt
				Output Ex: ls -l > newText1.txt   ----------output all files list to newText1.txt
				Errors  Ex: ls -l 2> newError.txt   ----------output error to newError.txt .It was possible because of "2>"
				
				ls -l > newError.txt 2>&1  ---------to print both ouput and error if occurs.
				
				input has the less than sign and output has the greater than sign. 
				
			
			Note:Grep stands for global regular expression print.
					Ex: grep -w wordToSearch fileName.txt      -----here -w flage lets you get the exact match
