Note:
All the data in React can be divided into props data and states data.
Props data is data outside the components that it receives and works with but cannot mutate. 
State data is data inside the components that it controls and can mutate.
It also helps to think of it like this. 
The prop data are belongs to the parent that renders the components. The state data belongs to the component itself.
 
Note:
While passing props helps to manage states, it is like taking a bus and going through each stop before you get off at the end. 
In comparison, using the context API is like teleporting to your destination instantly. 
It's a way to bypass the redundant passing of data through multiple levels of components. 
To set it up, you need to add a piece of code that will be your context provider.
It's also where the state will be stored. When a component needs to use the state, it becomes a context consumer.
